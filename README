This is the source code which calculates the thermodynamic functions of electrons in the Thomas-Fermi model with quantum and exchange corrections.

The main functions to calculate are:
- Pressure and thermal pressure
- Energy and thermal energy
- Entropy
- Chemical potential and thermal chemical potential

Compile and run:

The code is adapted for usage only at *nix platforms.

Before compilation, the 'numeric' library must be cloned into ./lib directory.
Compilation may be prepared separately for Thomas-Fermi potential, correction to potential, FTTF model, and quantum and exchange corrections. Each binary file appears in ./bin directory. Typical commands:
$ make FTTFpot - Thomas-Fermi potential
$ make FTTFQEpot - quantum and exchange corrections to the Thomas-Fermi potential
$ make FTTFmodel - the Thomas-Fermi model
$ make FTTFQEmodel - the quantum and exchange corrections to the Thomas-Fermi model

./in directory contains input files for running programm. ./out directory contains output files. Input and output files can be transferred as command line arguments (see run script). ./res directory contains files with tables of precalculated values of the Thomas-Fermi potential and its correction for acceleration. Simple periodic table of elements (with charge and atomic mass) is also included.

For debug or additional information it is possible to turn on writing log files in command line arguments. The information will appear in ./log directory. FTTFmodel and FTTFQEmodel have 2 levels of log writing: general information (1) and log for each point (2). 

Typical run commands are gathered in run script.
