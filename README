This is the source code which calculates the thermodynamic functions
of electrons in the Thomas-Fermi model with quantum and exchange corrections.

The usage is rather simple: you set the range of temperatures and 
volume/density/concentration of atoms and get in the output the tables of 
thermodynamic functions.

The main functions to calculate are:
-Pressure and thermal pressure
-Energy and thermal energy
-Entropy
-Chemical potential and thermal chemical potential

It is also possible to calculate caloric EOS (E - 3/2PV), thermal (PV/T) and
regions of validity. These features are not very useful in this version, but
in the nearest future all functionality and documentation will be available.
